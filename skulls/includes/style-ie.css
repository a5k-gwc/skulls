/*** Support for display: inline-block; ***/
/* The line "display: inline-block;" gives hasLayout, the line "display: inline;" reset the display as desired, without taking back hasLayout. */
/* So we need both values for IE 7 and earlier but they mustn't be in a single rule, otherwise it doesn't work completely. */
div.container { *display: inline; }  /* The asterisk makes it usable only by IE 7 and earlier (that is exactly where we need it) */
